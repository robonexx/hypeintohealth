          Here are three exercise lists to kickstart your fitness journey. The
          key is to simply start working out; it's not about the quantity but
          the consistency. Every step you take is progress, so keep that in
          mind. Begin with 1 - 5 exercises, and gradually add more as you go
          along. And remember, there's no need to rush; we're in this for the
          long haul! Keep pushing forward ðŸ˜‰. If you want to create your own
          routine from the existing lists you can do so here...{' '}
