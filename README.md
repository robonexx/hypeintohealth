I did a training app, with some lists suggesting exercises that you can do at home. 
You have the possiblity to add your own exercises saved on local storage. 

## Tech used in this project

-   Vite
-   React
-   React-router-dom
-   TypeScript
-   Tailwind
-   Framer-motion
-   LocalStorage

Task was to use hooks

-   UseEffect


## What I Learned?

I stumbled on a lot of issues, so debugging with developer tools, and here is where Typescript becomes very powerful when using data, you can see every argument a component needs etc, and if something is missing or wrong it wont push it up to vercel and will give you the errors so you can handle them before it actually is visible. Very good. üòç

I've started learning more about and getting deeper knowledge for the use of Typescript and its benefits and issues it solves. 

Example of one issue i stumbled up on...
### Issue using routes on vercel:
Gives a 404 pages when trying to go to other pages then home /

fixed by adding a vercel.json file with the below directives
{
  "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
}

This was fun and challenging. Or Tailwind was... (I Like to do my own styling in css or sass, also styled components, coming up in next project ü•≥ )
